In the UK "Bread and butter pudding" is a common recipe, in America the same recipe is known as "Cold bread Pudding". Both originate from 18th century English recipe styles called 'Whitepot', which involved using bone marrow. 
In example an 18th century whitepot recipe, "Baked Marrow Pudding":

"Take a pint of cream & boyle in it 2 rase of ginger, a little sugar & let it cool. Put to it 6 eggs, 2 whites, half a spoonfulls of flower. Then have some sippits of bread toasted & some raisons, some lumps of marrow, & butter ye bottom of your dish very well & lay a lairer of sippits & then a layer of raisins & then 6 spoonsfulls of cream, than a layer of marrow, then raisins & sippits again & cream, & so fill yr dish. Put a lid of puff paste at top. 3 qrs of an hour bakes it."
